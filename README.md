# 🐍 SnakeNN: The Brainiest Snake You’ll Ever Meet! 🧠✨

Hey there, adventurer! Welcome to **SnakeNN**, where the classic Snake game gets a futuristic makeover with some serious AI flair! This isn’t just a snake chasing apples—it’s a neural-network-powered genius learning to slither smarter with every bite. Ready to dive into this maze of code and chaos? Let’s get started! 🚀

## 🎉 What’s SnakeNN All About?

Imagine the Snake game you know and love, but with a twist: this snake’s got a PhD in AI! Using **PyTorch**, **reinforcement learning**, and a sprinkle of curiosity, SnakeNN evolves as it plays. It dodges walls, navigates mazes, and hunts food like a pro—all thanks to its dynamic neural network that grows and prunes itself on the fly. Whether you’re here to play manually or watch the AI flex its brainpower, SnakeNN is your ticket to a wild ride! 🐍💡

## 🛠️ Before You Begin: What You’ll Need

To unleash this clever critter on your machine, make sure you’ve got the essentials:

- **Python 3.7+** 🐍 – The snake’s native tongue!
- **Git** 🌿 – To snag the repo like a boss.
- A dash of curiosity and a love for techy fun! 🤓
- **Optional**: An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for turbo-charged AI training. No GPU? No worries—it’ll still run on CPU! 💪

## 📥 Installation: Let’s Get Slithering!

Ready to set up SnakeNN? Follow these steps, and you’ll be up and running faster than a snake chasing a mouse! 🐭

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   Fire up your terminal and grab the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnakeNN.git
   cd SnakeNN
Boom! You’ve just teleported into SnakeNN HQ! 🏰

Install the Goodies
Time to equip your snake with its tools. Run this command to install the required libraries:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install pygame numpy torch
Pygame: Renders the snake’s world in glorious pixels. 🎨
NumPy: Crunches numbers like a champ. 🧮
PyTorch: The brain juice for our snake’s neural net. 🧠
Got a GPU? Install the CUDA version of PyTorch for extra speed—check PyTorch’s site for the right command! ⚡
Test Your Setup
Make sure everything’s in place with this quick check:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python -c "import pygame, numpy, torch; print('Ready to roll! 🐍')"
If you see “Ready to roll! 🐍”, you’re golden! If not, double-check your installs.
GPU Bonus Round
Got an NVIDIA GPU? Let’s make sure it’s ready to rumble:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python -c "import torch; print('GPU Ready!' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'No GPU, but we’ll manage!')"
“GPU Ready!” means you’re in for a fast ride. Otherwise, the CPU will still get the job done—just a bit slower. 🏎️
🎮 How to Play (or Watch the AI Show Off!)
SnakeNN offers two ways to enjoy the action. Pick your poison! ☕

1. Manual Mode
Take the reins and steer the snake yourself!

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python SnakeRL.py
Controls:
Arrow Keys ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ – Move your snake.
ESC – Bail out when you’re done.
M – Speed it up!
N – Slow it down!
Show that snake who’s boss! 👑
2. AI Mode
Sit back and let the neural network strut its stuff.

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python SnakeNeuralAdvanced.py
Watch the snake learn, dodge, and grow smarter.
Press ESC to stop the show.
Bonus: It’ll even navigate mazes and adapt its strategy over time! 🌟
🌟 Cool Features to Brag About
🧠 Dynamic Neural Net: Neurons grow and shrink as the snake learns—talk about brain plasticity!
🔍 Curiosity Boost: The snake explores like a kid in a candy store, driven by novelty and surprise.
🎯 Maze Master: Tackles simple and complex mazes with style.
🔄 Skill Transfer: Learns tricks in one game and applies them to new challenges.
📈 Visual Goodies: See the AI’s progress with optional graphs (if you’re into that nerdy stuff).
🐛 Oops! Troubleshooting Tips
Ran into a snag? Here’s how to wriggle out of trouble:

Game Too Slow?
On CPU? That’s normal—try a smaller maze or fewer episodes.
GPU lagging? Check if CUDA’s set up right with the test command above.
Install Fails?
Missing a library? Re-run pip install pygame numpy torch.
Version clash? Use a virtual environment:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pygame numpy torch
Crashes?
Ensure Python is 3.7+. Check with python --version.
Peek at the terminal for error clues and holler in the issues section if you’re stuck!
Pro Tip: Keep your terminal handy—it’s your snake whisperer! 🗣️
